== Description ==

WP e-Commerce extension that allows you to add simple "product options" to products without having to create or manage variations.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Create your product options under the "Products" menu
4. Assign product options to your products


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The options aren't displayed on the product page =
It's likely that your theme doesn't include the hooks you need. You'll need to ensure that your theme contains the standard WP e-Commerce hook
"wpsc_product_form_fields_begin". You can see the official WP e-Commerce version here, in wpsc-single_product.php here: https://github.com/wp-e-commerce/WP-e-Commerce/blob/3.8.14/wpsc-theme/wpsc-single_product.php#L77


= The options chosen are supposed to be displayed during checkout - where are they? =
The current stable release of WP e-Commerce doesn't have the hooks to allow external plugins to display info like this during checkout. They're coming in a future version - watch this space

= Can I change the price charged according to the option chosen? =
No, if you want the product options to affect stock, or pricing then you should use WP e-Commerce's built in "Variations" functionality

= Where can I see which product options have been chosen =
Product options are shown against the sale under Store Sales in your WordPress Dashboard menu

= Can I order the options as they're shown to the customer? =
Yes, install a taxonomy ordering plugin - I recommend http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/taxonomy-terms-order/ Once you've set an order in the admin area, that will be honoured on the front end.
